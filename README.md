### About myself
PHey, I'm Faizan Ahmad, a third-year student at L.D College of Engineering. I'm pretty good with programming languages like C, C++, Java, and web stuff like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I also know my way around databases, especially MySQL.

I'm always eager to learn more. I love using tech to make things better for people. Creating cool websites and making sure they work great for usersâ€”that's my jam!

I'm here to explore, learn, and use tech to make a real difference.
